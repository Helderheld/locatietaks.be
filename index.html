    <section id="land-economics">
        <p> This page explains the economic concepts which are necessary to understand the economical arguments
        in favour of the Location Tax. Within mainstream economics, the classification of land as a form of capital
        is widespread, primarily driven by mathematical convenience rather than a persuasive rationale. However,
        it is crucial to recognize the distinction between land and capital, as this distinction underlies many of
        the inherent contradictions within the capitalist production of space (Ward & Aalbers, 2016, p. 1766).
        The chapter describes the main theories on land and rent, with the intention to find out how the price
        of land and rent come to be, and to make the distinction between land and capital clear. This chapter is
        built up chronologically to provide an insight into how theories of land and rent evolved. Early authors
        mainly refer to agricultural land rent, while more recent authors build on this work but more often write
        about urban rent</p>
        
        <h1> 1 Factors of Production and Their Rewards </h2>
        
        <p> Classical economists identified three factors of production: land, labour, and capital (Smith, 1776/2007;
        Ricardo, 1821/2001). The rewards for using these factors productively are respectively called rents, wages,
        and interests. Contemporary sources often look at land as “just another form of capital” (Dodson, 2005)
        or add entrepreneurship as a fourth factor (Fernando, 2023). Since land as a production factor is essential
        to this thesis, it is important to clearly define these production factors. The choice is made to use the
        definitional framework Henry George used in his most influential book Progress and Poverty (1879), as
        these definitions are the very relevant when defining the location tax. </p>
        
        <h2> 1.1 Land and Rents </h2>
        
        <p> Land as a production factor is more than just the soil we use for agriculture or to build houses on top.
        Land represents every natural opportunity: i.a. land, natural resources (e.g. gold), natural monopolies
        (e.g. broadcasting frequencies), patent rights (e.g. the right to commercialize a medicine), etc. Or as
        George calls it (1879/2017, p. 38): “the whole material universe outside of man himself”.
        Economic rent is the return for using nature as a production factor. Today, rent is commonly used
        to describe housing rent, the monthly pay one makes to the landlord. While this monthly pay does
        include rent, it does not fully consist out of rent. The landlord collects rent for the land, a wage for his
        administrative tasks, and interests on the house (George, 1879/2017, p. 165).</p>
        
        <h2> 1.2 Labour and Wages </h2>
        
        <p> Labour includes both physical and intellectual work. George points out that a person’s skill and knowl-
        edge are often described as capital, while they should be considered an increase in labour power. He
        acknowledges that increased skill or knowledge has the same effect as an increase in capital but sees
        no reason to put it in the same category. He uses the following analogy to strengthen his argument:
        “Increased velocity may give to the impact of a cannonball the same effect as increased weight, yet,
        nevertheless, weight is one thing and velocity another.” The fruits of a person’s labour is called a wage
        (George, 1879/2017, p. 38).</p>
        
        <h2> 1.3 Capital and Interests </h2>
        
        <p> Capital is everything that is not included in land or labour. It consists of the results of bringing together
        land and labour in a productive process. Interests are “the return for the use of capital, exclusive of
        any labour in its use or management, and exclusive of any risk, except such as may be involved in the
        security” (George, 1879/2017, pp. 38, 157).</p>

        <h1> 2 Monopoly Price </h1>
        
        <p> According to Smith (and earlier the Physiocrats), land rent signifies the payment made for the inherent
        value provided by nature itself. However, asserting that land serves as a source of value is incongruous
        with the labour theories of value that predominated in classical political economy (Ward & Aalbers, 2016,
        p. 1762). Smith (1776/2007, p. 118) defines land rent as follows:</p>    
        
        <blockquote> “The rent of land, therefore, considered as the price paid for the use of the land, is naturally
        a monopoly price. It is not at all proportioned to what the landlord may have laid out upon
        the improvement of the land, or to what he can afford to take; but to what the farmer can
        afford to give.” </blockquote>

        <p> It is important to understand why Smith calls rent a monopoly price, as it is clear landlords have to
        compete, lowering prices. Smith describes monopolies as having a similar effect to trade or manufac-
        turing secrets. By deliberately keeping the market undersupplied and not meeting the full demand,
        monopolists can sell their commodities at prices well above the natural price. This allows them to earn
        higher wages or profits. Exclusive privileges of corporations, statutes of apprenticeship, and other laws
        that limit competition in specific industries can have a similar, although lesser, impact. They act as
        expanded monopolies, keeping the market price of certain goods above the natural price for extended
        periods. Monopoly prices are always the highest that can be obtained, while natural prices, driven by free
        competition, are generally the lowest that sellers can afford to accept while still sustaining their business.
        Land has a natural price close to zero, as there are little to no costs associated with leasing out a land.
        So, the price of land, the highest value the landowner can obtain, is clearly a monopoly price (Smith,
        1776/2007, p. 52). </p>
        
        <p> Smith (1776/2007, p. 117) describes rent as the price paid for the use of land, determined by the tenant’s
        ability to afford it in the current circumstances. When setting the terms of a land lease, the landlord
        will leave the tenant not more than the portion of the produce that is sufficient for the tenant to cover
        expenses (such as seed, labour, and farming equipment) and have a small profit margin. This portion is
        the minimum share necessary for the tenant to avoid losses. Any surplus beyond this share is retained by
        the landlord as rent for the land. This portion can be considered the natural rent of the land, representing
        the amount for which land is generally leased. Occasionally, the landlord’s generosity or lack of knowledge
        may lead to accepting less than this portion, while the tenant’s ignorance may cause them to agree to
        pay more or settle for less than the typical profits. </p>
        
        <p> Another important fact pointed out by Smith is that rents do not set prices, but follow prices (Smith,
        1776/2007, p. 118): </p>
        
        <blockquote> “Rent, it is to be observed, therefore, enters into the composition of the price of commodities
        differently from wages and profit. High or low wages and profit are the causes of high or low
        prices; high or low rent is the effect of it. It is because high or low wages and profit must
        be paid, to bring a particular commodity to market, that its price is high or low. But it is
        because its price is high or low; a great deal more, or very little more, or no more, than what
        is sufficient to pay those wages and profit, that it affords a high rent, or a low rent, or no rent
        at all.” </blockquote>
        
        <h1> Differential Rent</h1>3 
        
        <p> James Anderson (1777, p. 376) is said to be the first one to describe the law of rent: </p>
        
        <blockquote> “Many persons will, therefore, be desirous of obtaining possession of these fertile fields, and
        will be content to give a certain premium for the privilege to cultivate them; which will be
        greater or smaller according to the more or less fertility of the soil. It is this premium which
        constitutes what we now call rent, a medium by which the expense of cultivating soils of very
        different degrees of fertility may be reduced to perfect equality.” </blockquote>
